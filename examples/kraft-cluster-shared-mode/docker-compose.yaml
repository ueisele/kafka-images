# In KRaft mode, only a small group of specially selected servers can act as controllers 
# (unlike the ZooKeeper-based mode, where any server can become the Controller). 
# The specially selected controller servers will participate in the metadata quorum. 
# Each controller server is either active, or a hot standby for the current active controller server.
#
# You will typically select 3 or 5 servers for this role, 
# depending on factors like cost and the number of concurrent failures your system should withstand without availability impact. 
# Just like with ZooKeeper, you must keep a majority of the controllers alive in order to maintain availability. 
# So if you have 3 controllers, you can tolerate 1 failure; with 5 controllers, you can tolerate 2 failures.
